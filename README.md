# Python-for-Data-Analysis-

Bank Costumer Data frames are created, manipulated and analysed.

Pandas, numpy and matplotlib packages are used

NumPy and Pandas are two of the most widely used python libraries in data science. They offer high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools. In this hands-on project, we will complete the following tasks:

Task #1: define single and
multi-dimensional NumPy arrays

Task #2: leverage NumPy built-in methods
and functions

Task #3: perform mathematical operations in
NumPy

Task #4: perform arrays slicing and
indexing

Task #5: perform elements selection
(conditional)

Task #6: understand pandas fundamentals

Task #7: pandas with csv and html data

Task #8: pandas operations

Task #9: pandas with functions

Task #10: perform sorting and ordering in
pandas

Task #11: perform concatenating and merging
with pandas

Task #12: project and concluding remarks
